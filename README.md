# DDoS Attack Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning techniques. It applies classification algorithms such as Random Forest and CatBoost to network traffic data to identify malicious traffic.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `DataCollection.ipynb` – Data loading and preprocessing
- `Random_Forest_Algorithm_Testing.ipynb` – Random Forest model training & testing
- `RandomForest_ddos.ipynb` – DDoS detection using Random Forest
- `CatBoost_Algorithm_Testing.ipynb` – CatBoost model experiments
- `CatboostClassification_ddos.ipynb` – DDoS classification with CatBoost
- `CatboostClassifier_trafficdata.ipynb` – Traffic data classification
- `TrafficDataset_Comparison.ipynb` – Comparison of model performance

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- CatBoost
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses network traffic datasets (e.g., KDD Cup 99).  
Due to size limitations, datasets are not included in this repository.  
Please download them separately and place them in the appropriate folder before running the notebooks.
